INSTALL-POSTFIX

If you want to configure a Postfix server with virtual users in SQL
database, you can use PostfixAdmin which is a web administration panel. His
package provides the needed SQL schema and the vacation script to manage your
users. A copy of the schema is in contrib/ directory (postfix-schema.sql). Take
a look in the directory VIRTUAL_VACATION/ of postfixadmin to configure the
vacation responder on your server instance.

The default configuration of rc-vacation is for this schema, so no change is
necessary for the SQL requests.
