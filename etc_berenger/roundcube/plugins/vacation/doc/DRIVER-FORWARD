DRIVER-FORWARD

This driver is a backend storage for user '.forward' file and the vacation
program.

It will generate these files :
- .forward
- .vacation.msg
- .vacation.db

But they must normally be owned by the local user. To allow your web user
to create them, you need to configure your MTA to disable rights and owner
checks. A safe method is to create a custom directory to store them :

	/var/spool/forward/							rwxr-xr-x www-data:www-data
	/var/spool/forward/bhuisgen/				rwxr-xr-x www-data:www-data
	/var/spool/forward/bhuisgen/.forward 		rw-r--r-- www-data:www-data
	/var/spool/forward/bhuisgen/.vacation.msg 	rw-r--r-- www-data:www-data
	/var/spool/forward/bhuisgen/.vacation.db	rw-rw-rw- www-data:www-data

For Sendmail MTA, you can use DontBlameSendmail option to allow unsafe
rights on .forward file :

	DontBlameSendmail=forwardfileinunsafedirpath,forwardfileinunsafedirpathsafe

For changing the forward path use this setting :

	define(`confFORWARD_PATH',`/var/spool/forward/$u/.forward')dnl

For Postfix MTA, a patch is needed to disable the owner/rights checks. The 
patch is in contrib/ directory. The forward_path variable need to be set :

	forward_path=/var/spool/forward/$user/.forward

Finally use the settings vacation_forward_create_dir_mode and
vacation_forward_database_file_mode of this driver. The vacation dates and 
forwarding address are not supported so disable them for the GUI.

Configuration settings :

- vacation_forward_path : path of the forward file.
- vacation_forward_file : forward filename.
- vacation_forward_create_dir : create the forward path if not exists.
- vacation_forward_message_file : the user vacation message file.
- vacation_forward_create_dir_mode : the rights to set for the forward path.
- vacation_forward_database_file : the user vacation message database.
- vacation_forward_database_file_mode : the rights to set for the vacation
message database. 
- vacation_forward_vacation_command : the vacation binary command.
- vacation_forward_message_template : the vacation message template. Each line
must be ended by \r\n. A empty line must separate the headers from the content.

Configuration syntax :

The driver replaces these predefined keys into each variable except 
vacation_forward_message_template :
- %username : the user mail or username.
- %email : the email of the user.
- %email_local : the email local part if username is a full email. 
- %email_domain : the email domain if the username is a full email.
